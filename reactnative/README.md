# Hyperbeam React Native example

This is a simple example of how to use Hyperbeam in a React Native app.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the Metro bundler
4. Run `npm run ios` to start the iOS app
5. Run `npm run android` to start the Android app

## Debugging Locally

- Start the app with `npm run ios` or `npm run android`
- Open the React Native In-App Developer Menu by shaking the device or pressing `Ctrl+M` on Windows or `Cmd+M` on macOS
- Open `chrome://inspect` in Chrome and click "inspect" on the device you want to debug

Refer to the [React Native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging) for more information.

## Why not Expo?

Expo is a great tool for getting started with React Native, but we aren't using it here as it does not support toggling webview debugging.
See [this issue](https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/support-running-debugger-against-webview-without-native-changes) for more information.
