# Hyperbeam Proxy example

You will need to purchase a proxy from a proxy provider, such as [Proxy Cheap](https://app.proxy-cheap.com/r/X9CqGe).

In `server.js`, make sure to replace `pacIP`, `pacUsername`, `pacPassword` with your proxy's values.

Once that's done, install and run the project:

```
npm install
npm run start
```
